I Don't Know how is your life going. but if its rough, just know that everything is gonna be alright. there's still so many time to figure the life out.
take your time and relax. think about the future and get hope for it. im sure you can do it well. be strong and safe, spend your life before it ends. go for your dream, and make it became true.
don't ever give up.
